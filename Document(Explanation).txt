I have created a state for holding the tasks,where I can add a task, which can be updated, deleted and moved. I created separate components for each
field where data has been passed using props. The Update and Delete handler take in the id of the task as an input and update or delete it accordingly.
The export to Excel was successful using the react-csv package. Thanks!
